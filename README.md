# README: Data Preprocessing - Encoding and Feature Scaling

## 📋 About This Notebook
This Jupyter Notebook is your go-to guide for preprocessing data efficiently before feeding it into machine learning models. It covers the essential techniques of:

- **Encoding** categorical data into machine-readable numerical formats.
- **Feature Scaling** to normalize or standardize data for improved model performance.

Whether you are new to data preprocessing or looking for reusable functions, this notebook has you covered!

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔑 Encoding Techniques
1. **Label Encoding**: Convert categories into numbers (e.g., `Red -> 1, Green -> 2`).
2. **One-Hot Encoding**: Create binary columns for each category.
3. **Custom Encoding**: Tailored solutions for specific datasets.

### 📏 Feature Scaling Methods
1. **Min-Max Scaling**: Scale values to a range of [0, 1].
2. **Standardization (Z-score)**: Normalize data with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1.
3. **Robust Scaling**: Handle outliers by scaling based on interquartile range.

### 🛠️ Modular Functions
- Clean and reusable Python functions for encoding and scaling.
- Plug-and-play with minimal changes for your datasets.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Open the Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook encoding_and_scaling.ipynb
   ```

3. **Follow the Steps**:
   - Run each cell in order.
   - Replace the sample data with your dataset to preprocess it.

## 💡 Tips for Success
- Use **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical features without order.
- Use **Standardization** for algorithms sensitive to scale (e.g., SVM, KNN).
- Explore your data first to decide the best preprocessing technique.
